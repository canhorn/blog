This is a list of websites I use in my development, some fiddle type tools, others drawing tools, or development tools.

## [Azure DevOps](https://visualstudio.com) 

This is my main personal code repository and build pipeline management site. This is where my private repositories are stored and I use the Azure Pipeline feature to build/test/package/publish my project from here as well. 

## [GitHub](https://github.com)

This is where my public repositories are stored. Mostly just GitHub sites, but their are currently a few hidden gems saved here as well.

## [Trello](https://trello.com)

I use trello to display my work publicly, so persons external to my other tools can keep track of my project roadways.

## [Code Sandbox](https://codesandbox.io)

Used as a nice React/TypeScript/Vue playground. Has a really nice feature that allows for the site to be exported, and these are normally fully functional applications when exported.

## [draw.io](https://about.draw.io/)

A really nice diagram markup tool, all from a browser. I found it very intuitive to create an environnement architecture map.

## [Pastebin.com](https://pastebin.com/)

A quick and easy way to share text, not much else to say here.

## [.NET Fiddle](https://dotnetfiddle.net/)

Very nice fiddle tool for a .NET environment. Has the ability to write in C# and F#, and comes in handy to hammer out quick a test script. Also has a nice ability to play around with a small MVC application for ASP .NET.

## [CodePen](https://codepen.io/)

This is the same as codesandbox, but has some nice examples that can be explored on the site. Example: https://codepen.io/anon/pen/rXyOze

## [Imgbb](https://imgbb.com)

A convenient site I used to host gifs and images to the public.

## [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/)

I don't use this site as much anymore, now prefer to use [CodePen](https://codepen.io/) nowadays.
