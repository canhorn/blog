Available Now! Today you can try a new way to Development Games.

I set out with a focus:

> Making Game Development Accessible to more People, by making an environment available from anywhere.

With that in mind I setout to built a Game Development Platform that could be accessed from a Browser. And by giving a developer access to resources that will allow for them to create a Game. I want to make the platform more advanced than a simple drag/drop editor but not as complicated as a full blown Game Editor. The platform will providing the building blocks for building a game, also taking some of complexity involved in more advanced features.    

> While the Platform is in Alpha there will be limited Availability.

<div style="font-size: 2rem; text-align: center; text-decoration: underline; padding: 1rem 1rem 2rem 1rem;">
    <a class="link" href="https://cloud.sandbox.ehzgames.studio/signup" target="_blank">Request Access to the Alpha!</a>
</div>

The Access Request will require an Account with the Platform. After you get access you can checkout the <a href="/blog/2021/01/24/Game-Development-Platform-Getting-Started.html">accompanying technical article here</a>.
