A quick post on the definition of SOLID, not by me, just a reminder of what it means.

# Definition

## Single-Responsibility Principle

> A class should only have a single responsibility, that is, only changes to one part of the software's specification should be able to affect the specification of the class.

## Openâ€“Closed Principle

> Software entities ... should be open for extension, but closed for modification.

## Liskov Substitution Principle

> Objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of that program.
    
## Interface Segregation Principle

> Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface

## Dependency Inversion Principle

> One should depend upon abstractions, [not] concretions.
